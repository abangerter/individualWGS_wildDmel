### INPUT FILES FOR SIMULATIONS 
The script getGenotypeProbabilities.R generates the probability table of genotypes based on alternate and reference read depths. It requires the file generated by script getSeqArrayGDSfile.R (found in data_processing directory)

The script buildPopulationArray.R builds an array that contains the list of individuals used in each simulation. It requires the file generated by scripts getHeterozygosityInfo.R (found in data_processing directory)

The script buildInputTables.R builds the read depth and allele frequency input tables used in each subset of simulations. It requires the files generated by the scripts buildPopulationArray.R, getSeqArrayGDSfile.R (found in data_processing directory), and getLDprunedSNPset.R (found in data_processing directory)

The script buildSimulationArray.R builds the array for submitting the simulations on our computing cluster. It gets start and stop positions so that SNPs are split into a way that makes fast computation with low memory demands feasible and builds up each simulation. It requires the files generated by the scripts buildPopulationArray.R and getLDprunedSNPset.R (found in data_processing directory)


### SIMULATION SCRIPTS
To run the simulations, you need to run all of the aboves scripts to generate the needed input files. The simulations were submitted to a computing cluster as an array of jobs where each line of a file had that simulations input arguments. The simulation script simulations.R is submitted by the script simulation.slurm. This outputs the raw simulation data that is later summarized as the raw information is needed for the various different summaries outlined in the directory 04_simulations_analysis. Warning: if you so choose to run this simulation script as presented here, the raw simulation data files are not large, but they are numerous. 


### FIGURES
The script figure_03.R generates Figure 03. It requires the file generated by script getGenotypeProbabilities.R
