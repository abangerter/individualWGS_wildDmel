### DRAFT README 


The script kinshipAnalysis_fig08.R contains the code to estimate KING kinship and IBS0, the plotting of figure 8, and the t-test to compare the within- and between-population estimates of kinship. 

It will require files generated by scripts getHeterozygosityInfo.R and getSNPRelateGDSfile.R
